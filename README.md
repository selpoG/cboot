# cboot

This tiny module for [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org) contains helper functions
to generate a bootstrap problem to be solved by [SDPB](https://github.com/davidsd/sdpb),
written originally for Ph.D. thesis of the author.
Almost the same functionality is offered by [PyCFTBoot](https://github.com/cbehan/pycftboot),
but the implementation detail and notation are somewhat different.
This makes extensive use of `sage.rings.real_mpfr.RealNumber`
and `rings.RealDensePolynomials` classes contained in Sage,
to handle arbitrary precision number/polynomials.

## Install

1. Install sage from source.
   This module has been originally written in the environment of sage-6.8 on OSX Yosemite,
   but confirmed to work up to sage-7.0.

1. Place cboot directory under `your/sage/src/sage`.
   The actual location of `your/sage/src` can be checked by running sage and enter `SAGE_ENV['SAGE_SRC']`
   In my environment, for example, this is `/Users/tomoki/sources/sage-6.8/src`.

1. Edit `your/sage/src/module_list.py` to add the following items in the variable `ext_modules`.

   ```python
   Extension('sage.cboot.context_object', sources=['sage/cboot/context_object.pyx', 'sage/cboot/partial_fraction.c', 'sage/cboot/integral_decomp.c', 'sage/cboot/chol_and_inverse.c', 'sage/cboot/context_variables.c'], extra_compile_args=['-std=c99'], libraries=['gmp','mpfr'], language='c'),

   Extension('sage.cboot.scalar_context', sources=['sage/cboot/scalar/scalar_context.pyx', 'sage/cboot/scalar/hor_formula.c', 'sage/cboot/scalar/hor_recursion.c', 'sage/cboot/scalar/k_compute.c'], include_dirs=['sage/cboot', 'sage/cboot/scalar'], depends=['sage/cboot/context_variables.h'], extra_compile_args=['-std=c99'], libraries=['gmp', 'mpfr'], language='c'),
   ```

1. Then run from your terminal `sage -b`.

## Examples

The example scripts are contained in `examples` folder. See `tutorial.pdf`.
